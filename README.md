# Event Streaming Platform (Work in progress)

## Motivation

Blockchain and Kafka are complementary, Kafka and the notion of blockchain share many traits, such as immutability, replication, distribution, and the decoupling of applications. If we are looking to extend the functionality of a given DLT(distributed ledger technology) through sidechain or off-chain activities, such as analytics, integrations with traditional enterprise systems, or even the integration of certain chains and ledgers.Â 

Crypto marketplaces, blockchain monitoring infrastructure, and custodian banking platforms are built on Kafka for good reasons (scale, reliability, real-time). Kafka and blockchain, respectively crypto are complementary. For instance, many enterprises use Kafka as the data hub between crypto APIs and enterprise software.
